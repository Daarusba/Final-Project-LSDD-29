## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of our project is to take a data set listing statistics about films, such as
their budget and revenue, and comparing that over entire genres and the film industry as a
whole. The audiences that we believe would most benefit from this analysis are movie
directors, screenwriters and producers. We are primarily focusing on movie producers as our
target audience, as they would be the most interested in looking at the performance of
films in order to see what is the most viable type of project to produce that induces the
least amount of risk. More specifically, we are addressing _four_ questions...

* Which genre of film tend to produce the highest amount of revenue in the box office?
* Which genre of film tend to be the most well-received critically?
* Which genre of film has tended to receive the largest budgets?
* Over the entire data set, how do revenue and budget correlate with one another?

## About the Data
The data itself is in the form of a csv file from the website,
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata#tmdb_5000_movies.csv). They
generated the data set using The Movie Database's API. They, and by extension Group LSD,
would like to emphasize that their product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or
certified by TMDb itself. The data set _was_ created within the year 2017, so it
therefore does not contain any information on films released after its conception, and is
further limited to what was available on TMDb at the time/what was accessed. This means
that certain contemporary films that would skew the data, such as Avengers: Endgame, are
absent. Oddly enough, and although we did not extensively search for more individual
cases, Get Out (2017) is also absent from the data set. This, again, brings into focus
that the data set is limited to what was available/what was accessed from TMDb.
