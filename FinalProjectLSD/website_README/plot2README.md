### Insights about the Ratings Plot 

The genre of film that, according to our data, had the highest mean,
average rating was the Drama genre with a rating of 6.4/10. This is quite interesting,
as this genre of film is usually taken more seriously among mainstream critics, and is
either legitimately, or simply subjectively, seen as being more "artful." It is also this
genre of film that has the habit of creating a stronger connection between the viewer and
the events/characters within the film, so Dramas are usually able to be quite impactful on
the viewer, compared to other genres. When looking at the data, however, there are
outliers (as discussed in "Summary") such as a film titled _Me You and Five Bucks (2015)_,
which is one of only two films within the data set that that have received an average
rating of 10/10. When searching for the film on Google, its ratings are more so floating at
or below 5/10. Film criticism is incredibly subjective, of course, but a difference such as
that is suspicious, to say the least. This is one of the more obvious outliers within the
data set, but it being so it should not be skewing the data so heavily as to invalidate the
finding that Drama films are on average the highest rated since, again, they can accomplish
affecting audiences in ways that other genres cannot as easily/effectively. Some notable Drama films included within the data set are _The Godfather (1972)_,
_Seven Samurai (1954)_, and _Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)_.
