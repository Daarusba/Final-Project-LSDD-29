### Insights about the Revenue Plot

The genre of film that, according to our data, had the highest mean
revenue was the Adventure genre with a revenue value of 208,660,204 USD.
This is likely helped in part due to the highest grossing film (as of June, 2019), _Avatar (2009)_ earned 2,787,965,087 USD, since this would heavily skew the mean of the genres it is
classified as, with those being Action, Adventure, Fantasy, and Science Fiction. In addition
to this, the adventure genre itself is also both incredibly broad and popular, including
films ranging from _Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)_, _Skyfall (2012)_, and even _Cars 2 (2011)_.
As such, there are plenty of high grossing films that could be classified as an "Adventure"
film. Some notable Adventure films included within the data set are _Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)_,
_The Princess Bride (1987)_, and _Aladdin (1992)_.
