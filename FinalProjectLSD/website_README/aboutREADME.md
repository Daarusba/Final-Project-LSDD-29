# Lelo Gemtessa

Lelo is...
Lelo was in charge of working on the logic to be used within the server that constructs
the plots, and finding insights to be listed about the plots and data. Lelo was also
responsible for spearheading the development of what the UI would look like/accomplish,
and was helpful in doing so.


# Shinichiro Aoyagi

Shin is...
Shin was in charge of constructing and code for the UI of the website, including its
widgets, and ensuring that it all was implemented correctly. Without this, the website
would have essentially been defunct.


# Darian Baruso

Darian is currently in his third year of attending the University of Washington.
He was primarily put to the task of constructing the logic to be used within the server
itself so that the plots and other logical elements would be implemented without issue.
Additionally, Darian wrote insights about the data, and constructed the admittedly
simple css file as a means to add some color to the page inspired by film stock. Darian
thoroughly enjoys film as an art form, so being able to construct code for statistical
analysis of the subject was rather enjoyable.
