### Insights about the Budget Plot

The genre of film that, according to our data, had the highest mean budget was the Adventure
genre with a budget value of 66.3 million USD. This does not come as a surprise, as it is easy to
picture how films filled with "adventurous" amounts of visual effects, set pieces, safety
precautions, computer-generated imagery, reshoots and whatever else the Adventure film requires would need such funds for their upkeep and production. Being anything from
over-the-top, real-life adventure to CG characters getting into mischief would help propel a
budget upwards. Of course, some of the elements previously mentioned, especially reshoots,
can effect *any* genre of film, but Adventure films specifically require a great deal in
order to successfully convey the "adventure" that they set out to. The same could be said
about Action films, but that is why most of the blockbuster films that are heavy with
elements such as explosions are usually qualified as "Action-Adventure" films. Even in
spite of this connection, the budgets of Adventure films pulled ahead within the data set.
Some notable Adventure films included within the data set are _Spirited Away, (2001)_,
_Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_, and _The Iron Giant (1999)_.
